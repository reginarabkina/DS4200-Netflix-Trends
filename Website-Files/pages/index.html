        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Netflix once dominated the global streaming industry, but now numerous platforms compete for viewers' attention. Streaming has become the new norm in a way, as it begins to replace cable television, with channels moving content to their own platforms. New competitors such as Max, Peacock, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and many more have entered the streaming arena. While Netflix still holds power in its respective industry, how has the application changed across the years? With new competition, it becomes clear that the platform must continue expanding its library as it has done in the past, but does this mean sacrificing quality in exchange for quantity? Additionally, does it cater to the same audience it always has, or has that shifted as time has progressed? Our project aims to analyze these questions, as well as many more, regarding Netflix and how it has adapted with time.

    <h3>Takeaways:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Consistent Median Ratings Across Different Lenghts</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Whether a film is short, medium, or long, the average audience rating stays fairly similar. The median scores are all close, meaning that simply making a movie longer or shorter doesn’t guarantee a better rating.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Audience Ratings Are Spread Out Similarly</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The range of typical ratings (from lower to upper quartiles) is quite similar across all three categories. This means that no particular length consistently leads to more unpredictable or varied reviews.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Some Lengths Have More Outliers Than Others</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Shorter films have the most extreme ratings, with both very high and very low scores appearing more often. Medium-length films also have some outliers, while longer films tend to stay within a more stable rating range. This could mean that short films are more of a “hit or miss” with audiences.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Slightly Higher Maximum Ratings for Short Media</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The highest-rated media appear more frequently in the Short category, suggesting that longer content may have a higher potential for strong audience reception. The highest-rated films in the dataset are short films, with a top rating of 9.3, slightly above the best-rated medium (9.2) and long (8.7) films. However, this doesn’t mean short films are always better—there are also more very low-rated short films compared to longer ones.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Implications:</h3>

        ul li {
          margin-bottom: 10px; 
        }
      </style>
    <ul>
        <li>Runtime alone is not a strong predictor of success. Instead, other factors such as storytelling, production quality, and genre are likely more influential in determining IMDB ratings.</li>
        <li>Investment in short-form content may yield higher highs, but it does not guarantee better ratings overall. While some of the highest-rated films are short, this category also sees more extreme reviews, both positive and negative. If we invest in short content, it should be carefully crafted to maximize impact and avoid pitfalls that lead to low ratings.
        </li>
        <li>A diverse content strategy remains valuable, as high and low ratings exist across all runtime categories. Offering a mix of short, medium, and long content is a smart approach. This way, we can capture different audience preferences while reducing risk.</li>

    <h3>Takeaways:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Strategic Shifts Over Time</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Netflix’s content strategy has evolved in response to changing industry dynamics. Initially, the platform focused on acquiring high-rated content to build credibility, then shifted toward mass content expansion to attract a broader audience, and later refined its approach by balancing quality with quantity.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>The Power of Originals</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The rebound in IMDB scores in 2013–2014 highlights the impact of Netflix’s investment in original programming. High-quality, exclusive content like House of Cards and Orange is the New Black became central to Netflix’s identity, helping it stand out in an increasingly competitive market.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Quality vs. Quantity</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Netflix’s fluctuating IMDB scores reflect the tension between content volume and quality. While rapid expansion led to a temporary decline in ratings, the company ultimately stabilized its approach by curating a diverse library that maintains a consistent level of quality while catering to a global audience.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Competition-Driven Changes</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The shifts in Netflix’s strategy align with changes in the streaming landscape. As competitors emerged, Netflix responded by scaling its content library, then refocusing on originals, and finally balancing both strategies to sustain its market dominance.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Implications:</h3>
    <style>
        ul li {
          margin-bottom: 10px; 
        }
      </style>
    <ul>
        <li>Netflix’s ability to adapt its content strategy based on viewer preferences and industry shifts has been crucial to its success. Streaming platforms must remain agile, continuously analyzing audience behavior and market trends to refine their offerings.</li>
        <li>The growing importance of original programming suggests that exclusive, high-quality content is essential for streaming platforms to maintain a competitive edge. Platforms that fail to invest in strong original productions risk losing audience engagement and brand loyalty.</li>
        <li>The evolution of Netflix’s strategy underscores the importance of finding the right balance between content volume and quality. A library that is too broad may dilute brand identity, while an overly selective approach may limit audience reach. The key lies in curating a diverse, high-quality catalog that appeals to different viewer segments.</li>
        <li>The trends in IMDB scores suggest that Netflix uses audience insights to fine-tune its content approach. Other streaming services can learn from this by leveraging data analytics to optimize content acquisition, production, and curation strategies.</li>
        <li>As the streaming industry continues to evolve, platforms must anticipate shifts in consumer expectations. Success will depend on their ability to balance content variety, maintain high production standards, and differentiate themselves through exclusive, compelling storytelling.</li>

    <h2>Average IMDB Score by Age Rating</h2>
    <p>The aim of this section of our analysis 
        is to gain insight into the relationship 
        between the age rating on content and viewer engagement.</p>
    <p>The figure is a horizontal bar chart with color encoding. 
        Each bar represents the average IMDB score of titles within a specific 
        age rating, while the bar color reflects the total number of votes received 
        — one possible measure of popularity.

<section id="barplot-description">
<h3>Key Points</h3>
<ul>
    <li>In general, as the level of maturity increases,
        the amount of votes on that level of content is greater.
        This is the case when we look up until the level R.
        NC-17 has significantly less votes than the rest of
        the age ratings due to the age certifications
        being far less popular than the rest listeed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Average score is pretty consistent across the 
        various age certifications, despite the frerquency of votes
        all being greatly different.
    </li>
    <li>
        Content rated TV-Y, TV-Y7, TV-G, and G tend to have 
        fewer total votes and slightly lower average scores. 
        This potentially means less IMDB user engagement with 
        content aimed at very young viewers — perhaps due to 
        IMDB’s adult-skewing user base. 
    </li>
    <li>
        NC-17 ratings have a small presence in Netflix content.
        This category appears with low scores and vote counts, indicating 
        it may represent niche or less mainstream content with 
        little access or appeal.
    </li>
</ul>

        The figure shows side-by-side boxplots for Netflix movies and shows. 
        Each boxplot represents one of the age categories/rating. 
        For each of these age ratings, the boxplot shows the distribution of the 
        IMDB scores for content in that certain age group.

    <h3>TV</h3>
    <p>
        The distributions for the boxplots largely overlap with one another. 
        This may indicate that Netflix is generally consistent with the quality of 
        content across various age certifications. 
        Several of the ratings have outliers, but for the ratings 'TV-MA' and 'TV-14', 
        there appear to be many outliers. Additionally, they seem to have whiskers 
        that extend across a spread out range of values compared to other ratings. 
        The 'G' rating appears to have the smallest spread, and is not majorly skewed in either direction.
    </p>
    <h3>MOVIE</h3>
    <p>
        The boxplots also overlap for the movies, showing pretty similar distributions. 
        However, content levels PG-13 and R appear to have a larger spread relative to 
        lower maturity levels. NC-17 has only one value, indicating that in this dataset, 
        there is probably just one NC-17 film. 
        PG has outliers on both the left and right side of the dsitribution. 
        PG-13 and R have numerous lower outliers.
    </p>
    <h3>NEXT STEPS</h3>
    <p>
        We can see that the majority of age ratings with outliers appear to be skewed to the left. 
        Thus, when we previously compared their averages in the barplot, 
        these may not be as meaningful than if we compare the medians. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We know that Netflix may have strategically utilized more "bingeable" content--often TV shows 
        that are TV-14 and TV-MA. 
        This could be the reasoning behind the larger frequency of votes. 
        In addition, they have many, many lower outliers, yet their average scores 
        still remain the second and third largest out of all the ratings 
        (by less than a tenth). Without outliers, the projected average ratings would be larger--and 
        probably by a significant amount.
