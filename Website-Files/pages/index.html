        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Netflix once dominated the global streaming industry, but now numerous platforms compete for viewers' attention. Streaming has become the new norm in a way, as it begins to replace cable television, with channels moving content to their own platforms. New competitors such as Max, Peacock, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and many more have entered the streaming arena. While Netflix still holds power in its respective industry, how has the application changed across the years? With new competition, it becomes clear that the platform must continue expanding its library as it has done in the past, but does this mean sacrificing quality in exchange for quantity? Additionally, does it cater to the same audience it always has, or has that shifted as time has progressed? Our project aims to analyze these questions, as well as many more, regarding Netflix and how it has adapted with time.

        <h2>IMDB Ratings by Media Runtime</h2>
        <p>This boxplot visualizes the distribution of IMDB scores for TV shows and movies, categorized by runtime length. The categories are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Short</strong>: Runtime ≤ 90 minutes</li>
            <li><strong>Medium</strong>: Runtime ≤ 150 minutes</li>
            <li><strong>Long</strong>: Runtime > 150 minutes</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Takeaways:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Consistent Median Ratings Across Different Lenghts</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Whether a film is short, medium, or long, the average audience rating stays fairly similar. The median scores are all close, meaning that simply making a movie longer or shorter doesn’t guarantee a better rating.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Audience Ratings Are Spread Out Similarly</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The range of typical ratings (from lower to upper quartiles) is quite similar across all three categories. This means that no particular length consistently leads to more unpredictable or varied reviews.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Some Lengths Have More Outliers Than Others</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Shorter films have the most extreme ratings, with both very high and very low scores appearing more often. Medium-length films also have some outliers, while longer films tend to stay within a more stable rating range. This could mean that short films are more of a “hit or miss” with audiences.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Slightly Higher Maximum Ratings for Short Media</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The highest-rated media appear more frequently in the Short category, suggesting that longer content may have a higher potential for strong audience reception. The highest-rated films in the dataset are short films, with a top rating of 9.3, slightly above the best-rated medium (9.2) and long (8.7) films. However, this doesn’t mean short films are always better—there are also more very low-rated short films compared to longer ones.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Implications:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Runtime alone is not a strong predictor of success. Instead, other factors such as storytelling, production quality, and genre are likely more influential in determining IMDB ratings.</li>
        <li>Investment in short-form content may yield higher highs, but it does not guarantee better ratings overall. While some of the highest-rated films are short, this category also sees more extreme reviews, both positive and negative. If we invest in short content, it should be carefully crafted to maximize impact and avoid pitfalls that lead to low ratings.
        </li>
        <li>A diverse content strategy remains valuable, as high and low ratings exist across all runtime categories. Offering a mix of short, medium, and long content is a smart approach. This way, we can capture different audience preferences while reducing risk.</li>
