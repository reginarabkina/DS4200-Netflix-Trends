This bar plot shows the number of ratings for each age category in our data set.
The groups are shown for both movies and tv shows in 
an order that reflects the increasing maturity level for the content.
When analyzing this graph, we can see that in general, at higher maturity levels,
there are a significantly greater number of votes on that content
relative to the lower maturity levels.

Looking back at the side by side box plots, we saw that for both movies and tv shows, at higher ratings,
excluding NR and NC-17, the spread of the data is larger. This could
be due to the fact that way more people are voting on content in those
maturity level categories. The distributions still do not differ much across
the age categories, but we have more consistent data with no outliers. 
This could come from the fact that the target audience watching this content
is most likely not going on the internet to vote on IMDb, such as a child
watching something with a TV-Y rating.
