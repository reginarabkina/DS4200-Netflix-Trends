The aim of this section of our analysis 
is to gain insight into the relationship 
between the age rating on content and viewer engagement.

The figure is a horizontal bar chart enhanced with color encoding. 
Each bar represents the average IMDb score of titles within a specific 
age rating, while the bar color reflects the total number of votes received 
— one possible measure of popularity.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
1. In general, as the level of maturity increases,
the amount of votes on that level of content is greater.
This is the case when we look up until the level R.
NC-17 has significantly less votes than the rest of
the age ratings due to the age certifications
being far less popular than the rest listeed.

2. Average score is pretty consistent across the 
various age certifications, despite the frerquency of votes
all being greatly different.

3. Content rated TV-Y, TV-Y7, TV-G, and G tend to have 
fewer total votes and slightly lower average scores. 
This potentially means less IMDb user engagement with 
content aimed at very young viewers — perhaps due to 
IMDb’s adult-skewing user base.

4. NC-17 ratings have a small presence in Netfliix content.
This category appears with low scores and vote counts, indicating 
it may represent niche or less mainstream content with 
little access or appeal.

Next, to get a better picture in case of skewed distributions for each age rating,
we will use a side-by-side boxplot showing the distributions for the levels.
