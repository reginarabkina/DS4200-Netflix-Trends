        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Netflix once dominated the global streaming industry, but now numerous platforms compete for viewers'
            attention. Streaming has become the new norm in a way, as it begins to replace cable television, with
            channels moving content to their own platforms. New competitors such as Max, Peacock, Amazon Prime Video,
            Hulu, and many more have entered the streaming arena. While Netflix still holds power in its respective
            industry, how has the application changed across the years? With new competition, it becomes clear that the
            platform must continue expanding its library as it has done in the past, but does this mean sacrificing
            quality in exchange for quantity? Additionally, does it cater to the same audience it always has, or has
            that shifted as time has progressed? Our project aims to analyze these questions, as well as many more,
            regarding Netflix and how it has adapted with time.

        <h3>Reference Papers</h3>
        <p>
            To learn more, you can visit the article <a href="https://academic.oup.com/joc/article/72/4/511/6605780">
                Netflix, Library Analysis, and Globalization: Rethinking Mass Media Flows</a>, which examines Netflix's
            2021 data, revealing strategies like offering binge-worthy shows and releasing content in multiple languages
            to appeal to a global audience.
            Another article,<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/15274764221100474">“We Don’t Aspire to Be
                Netflix”</a>, explores Netflix’s growth over time, highlighting its expansion to more countries, growing
            viewer bases, and use of user data for tailored recommendations.
            Both papers offer valuable insights into Netflix's evolving strategies, providing context for our analysis
            of Netflix trends and the changes observed in the data.
        </p>

        <h3>Introduction to the Data</h3>
        <p>
            For our analysis, we utilize two datasets from Kaggle: <a
                href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/netflix-imdb-scores/data">Netflix IMDB Scores</a>
            and <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rahulvyasm/netflix-movies-and-tv-shows"> Netflix Movies and TV
                Shows</a>.
            The merged dataset contains 10 columns and 2984 entries, spanning from 2008 to 2021. It provides a comprehensive
            overview of Netflix's content offerings during this period.
       
        <p>To better understand the dataset, we organize the features into the following <strong>key groups</strong>

        <p>
            <strong>title</strong>: Name of the movie or TV show.<br>
            <strong>type</strong>: Specifies if the entry is a movie or TV show.<br>
            <strong>listed_in</strong>: Genre(s) or categories the title falls under.<br>
            <strong>rating</strong>: Age-based content rating (e.g., PG, TV-MA).
        </p>

        <h3>Production & Release Details</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>release_year</strong>: Year the content was originally released.<br>
            <strong>country</strong>: Country of production.<br>
            <strong>date_added</strong>: When the title was made available on Netflix.
        </p>

        <h3>Performance & Engagement</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>imdb_score</strong>: IMDb user rating (0–10 scale).<br>
            <strong>imdb_votes</strong>: Number of user votes submitted to IMDb.
        </p>

        <h3>Runtime Information</h3>

<!-- General Overview & Trends -->
 <div class="subsection">
    <h2>General Overview & Trends</h2>
    <p>To understand Netflix's content library, we first analyze the distribution of IMDb scores across different
        media types. This provides a foundation for our analysis, allowing us to explore how Netflix's content
        strategy has evolved over time and how it has influenced audience reception.</p>
 </div>

                    <h3>Takeaways:</h3>
                    <h4>TV Shows</h4>
                    <p>TV shows have consistently maintained higher average IMDb scores than movies, especially since
                        2015. This indicates that TV series are resonating more strongly with viewers, potentially due
                        to better storytelling, more engaging formats, or higher production value.</p>

                    <h4>Movies</h4>
                    <p>In contrast, the average scores for movies have gradually declined and plateaued at a lower
                        level, signaling that recent movie additions may not be meeting the same quality expectations as
                        before.</p>

                    <p>This divergence highlights an opportunity for Netflix to double down on high-performing TV
                        content while re-evaluating its strategy for movie acquisitions. Investing more heavily in TV
                        series could enhance viewer satisfaction and retention, while a more curated approach to movie
                        content may lift overall perceived value and engagement.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <h3>Implications:</h3>
                <p>Consider allocating more content budget and marketing focus to TV series, which are delivering more
                    consistent quality and viewer satisfaction.</p>
                <p>A quality-focused strategy for movies may help improve perceived value. This could include more
                    selective licensing/acquisition and highlighting critically acclaimed titles in the UI.</p>
                <p>High-rated TV content is likely driving longer watch sessions and higher retention. Doubling down
                    here could reinforce customer loyalty.</p>
                <p>To go deeper, we could segment this trend by genre or region to better understand what types of
                    shows/movies are driving scores up or down.</p>

                    <h3>Takeaways:</h3>
                    <p>
                        The scatter plot reveals how the average IMDb ratings of movies and TV shows have fluctuated
                        over the years.
                        A noticeable trend (either upward or downward) could indicate shifts in audience preferences or
                        changes in
                        production quality.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Within the above data visualization, the size of the circles represents the number of releases
                        each year.
                        If certain years have significantly larger circles, it suggests peak periods in content
                        production, possibly influenced by factors like streaming platform expansions or major industry
                        shifts.

                        The outliers that can be seen within the dataset (e.g., a year with an unusually high or low
                        average rating) may signal
                        significant
                        events such as the rise of a particular genre, the influence of a major franchise, or changes in
                        industry
                        standards.

                <p>
                    Platforms like Netflix, Hulu, or HBO Max could use this data to assess past trends and determine
                    optimal
                    content release strategies.
                    If TV shows have consistently higher ratings than movies in certain periods, they might prioritize
                    show
                    production.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The major shifts (e.g., the rise of streaming services, global events like the pandemic, or
                    technological
                    advancements) can be analyzed in correlation with the data, providing insights into how external
                    factors influence entertainment consumption. This can then inform large streaming platforms on how
                    the number of releases
                    in a year can either improve or decrease the average rating of a show/move.

                    <h3>Takeaways:</h3>

                    <h4>TV Shows</h4>
                    <p>TV shows generally receive higher IMDb scores than movies across similar length categories. The
                        median score for TV shows is approximately 7.0, with medium-length shows performing the best,
                        reaching a median of around 7.5. This score is also matched by the single long TV show in the
                        dataset, although it's important to note the very limited sample size in that category. TV shows
                        tend to have a tighter distribution of core scores, indicating more consistent quality,
                        especially in the medium-length segment. However, short TV shows do show more low-end outliers,
                        suggesting higher variability in quality among shorter series.</p>

                    <h4>Movies</h4>
                    <p>Movies exhibit more variability in performance and tend to score slightly lower on average. Their
                        median IMDb scores typically range between 6.2 and 6.8. There is a mild positive correlation
                        between length and score—longer films tend to receive higher ratings than shorter ones. Long
                        movies, in particular, display the smallest variation in scores, pointing to a more consistent
                        quality level in that category. On the other hand, short and medium-length movies have a wider
                        range, including low-end outliers scoring between 1.5 and 3.0. Medium-length movies form the
                        largest sample group (n = 1376), giving more weight to observations in that category.</p>

                    <p>Overall, TV shows tend to outperform movies in terms of median IMDb scores, particularly in the
                        medium-length category. While both content types share a similar overall score range (typically
                        between 5 and 9), TV shows generally exhibit more consistent performance. The greater
                        variability in movies—especially among shorter formats—suggests a wider range of production
                        quality. These patterns highlight the potential value in prioritizing mid-length TV content for
                        high audience satisfaction, while also being mindful of outlier risks in shorter productions.

                    <h3>Implications:</h3>
                    <p>TV shows generally receive higher IMDb scores than movies, particularly medium-length series. For
                        Netflix, this suggests a continued emphasis on TV series development, especially medium-length
                        ones, as they seem to offer the best opportunity for positive viewer feedback and higher
                        engagement. Investing in high-quality TV shows may help drive user retention and attract new
                        subscribers.</p>
                    <p>Medium-length TV shows have the highest median scores, which means they strike the right balance
                        between viewer engagement and content depth. For Netflix, focusing on this format could be a
                        strategic move, ensuring high satisfaction while keeping viewers interested over several
                        episodes. This could also help in securing more critical acclaim and audience loyalty.</p>
                    <p>Movies, particularly shorter ones, show a higher degree of variability with more low-end outliers
                        in ratings. For Netflix, this could mean that shorter films might be more prone to disappointing
                        viewers. Netflix might want to be more selective about the short films they produce or acquire,
                        ensuring that they meet high-quality standards to avoid negative reviews and maximize success.

                    <h3>Takeaways:</h3>
                    <h4>TV Shows</h4>
                    <p>The distributions for the boxplots largely overlap with one another. This may indicate that
                        Netflix is generally consistent with the quality of content across various age certifications.
                        Several of the ratings have outliers, but for the ratings 'TV-MA' and 'TV-14', there appear to
                        be many outliers. Additionally, they seem to have whiskers that extend across a spread out range
                        of values compared to other ratings. The 'G' rating appears to have the smallest spread, and is
                        not majorly skewed in either direction.</p>

                    <h4>Movies</h4>
                    <p>The boxplots also overlap for the movies, showing pretty similar distributions. However, content
                        levels PG-13 and R appear to have a larger spread relative to lower maturity levels. NC-17 has
                        only one value, indicating that in this dataset, there is probably just one NC-17 film. PG has
                        outliers on both the left and right side of the distribution. PG-13 and R have numerous lower
                        outliers.</p>

                    <h3>Implications:</h3>
                    <p>We can see that the majority of age ratings with outliers appear to be skewed to the left. The
                        averages across all levels were similar, but the distributions indicate that for the more
                        popular categories—the ones that cater to more mature audiences—are possibly more well received,
                        as we saw in the initial findings.</p>
                    <p>In addition, they have more instances of positive feedback and less flat-out rejection. Mature
                        categories may correlate to greater success on Netflix’s platform, pointing to an opportunity to
                        continue producing a high proportion of R-rated or TV-MA content.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, we can see that age ratings for younger audiences tend to have smaller variability. This
                        is likely because these titles are already standardized and likely to have wider family
                        viewership. It might make sense to increase focus on maximizing the quality of content with
                        family-oriented age ratings, which are typically less likely to have major outliers.</p>

    <h2>Audience Engagement and Popularity</h2>
    <p>In this section, we will analyze the relationship between IMDb scores and audience engagement metrics,
        specifically focusing on the number of votes received. This analysis will help us understand how different
        content types resonate with viewers and how age ratings impact audience engagement.</p>

        <h3>Average IMDb Score by Age Rating</h3>
        <p>The aim of this section of our analysis is to gain insight into the relationship between the age rating on
            content and viewer engagement. The figure is a horizontal bar chart with color encoding. Each bar represents
            the average IMDb score of titles within a specific age rating, while the bar color reflects the total number
            of votes received — one possible measure of popularity. Hover over the bars to see the metrics.</p>

                    <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                    <p>As the level of maturity increases, the amount of votes on that level of content is greater. This
                        is the case until the maturity level R. NC-17 has significantly fewer votes than the rest of the
                        age ratings due to the age certifications being far less popular than the rest listed.</p>
                    <p>Average score is fairly consistent across the various age certifications, despite the frequency
                        of votes all being greatly different.</p>
                    <p>Content rated TV-Y, TV-Y7, TV-G, and G tend to have fewer total votes and slightly lower average
                        scores. This potentially means less IMDb user engagement with content aimed at very young
                        viewers — perhaps due to IMDb’s adult-skewing user base.</p>
                    <p>NC-17 ratings have a small presence in Netflix content. This category appears with low scores and
                        vote counts, indicating it may represent niche or less mainstream content with little access or
                        appeal.</p>

                    <h3>Implications:</h3>
                    <p>Streaming platforms and production companies should consider the larger engagement seen with
                        PG-13, R, and TV-MA rated content when planning releases or marketing strategies. These
                        categories clearly resonate more with IMDb’s user base, suggesting adult-oriented content
                        garners more interaction and discussion.</p>
                    <p>The lower vote counts for youth-rated content reflect IMDb’s likely adult-leaning user
                        demographic. Platforms targeting families or younger audiences may find that IMDb ratings don't
                        fully capture engagement from their core viewers and should rely on alternative metrics.</p>
                    <p>The sharp drop-off in votes for NC-17 content suggests a limited audience and potentially reduced
                        discoverability. This could impact content placement decisions for media that falls into that
                        rating, especially on mainstream platforms like Netflix.</p>
                    <p>Since age ratings correlate with vote volume, developers and researchers should be cautious using
                        IMDb data as a proxy for popularity or quality across all age groups. The data may overrepresent
                        certain segments (like adult viewers) and underrepresent others (like children or families).</p>
                    <p>While average score may be very similar, the popularity difference across maturity levels
                        indicates that we should look further into the individual distributions for each age rating.</p>

                    <h3>Takeaways:</h3>
                    <p>
                        The scatterplot reveals a potential relationship between the IMDb rating and the number of
                        reviews (votes) a movie or TV show has received. <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through this visualization we can see that movies and TV shows with higher ratings often tend to
                        have a
                        larger number of reviews, especially if they are well-known or widely appreciated by the
                        audience.
                        This indicates that the most popular and highly rated content tends to accumulate more reviews
                        over time.
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition, there may be some content with high IMDb ratings but fewer
                        reviews, possibly indicating niche content, older movies, or shows that were well-received by a
                        smaller
                        audience.

                <h3>Implications:</h3>
                <p>
                    A higher number of reviews might correlate with greater audience
                    engagement. Content that generates more reviews could indicate that it is widely discussed,
                    analyzed, or critiqued, suggesting it is popular or has a passionate fanbase.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Studios and content creators could use this data to assess the level of engagement with their
                    content. For example, if a film or series has a high rating but low votes, it may indicate that
                    while the content is well-received, it has not reached a large audience or lacks the viral quality
                    that drives more people to review it.

    <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The analysis of IMDb ratings across various factors, including media length, Netflix's content strategy,
            maturity levels, and audience engagement, has revealed several valuable insights.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="key-findings">
        <h3>Key Findings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Media Length and Ratings:</strong><br>
                Runtime alone is not a strong predictor of audience reception. Short films exhibit broader rating
                variability, making them riskier investments, while longer films tend to receive more consistent scores.
                However, TV shows—particularly those of medium length—show the best balance between viewer engagement
                and content quality, generally outperforming movies in terms of IMDb scores.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Netflix’s Content Strategy:</strong><br>
                Netflix has transitioned from acquiring highly-rated content to focusing on original programming. The
                platform’s emphasis on TV series, particularly medium-length ones, has proven to be more successful,
                offering better viewer retention and satisfaction. The rise in TV show ratings suggests that investing
                further in this format, while refining movie acquisitions, could enhance Netflix's content strategy.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Maturity Ratings and Audience Engagement:</strong><br>
                PG-13, R, and TV-MA content consistently receive the highest engagement on IMDb, with the number of
                reviews and votes serving as indicators of popularity and audience interaction. Conversely,
                youth-oriented and NC-17 content tend to have lower engagement, likely due to IMDb’s adult-skewed user
                base. Platforms targeting younger audiences may need to rely on alternative engagement metrics for more
                accurate assessments.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Ratings and Review Volume:</strong><br>
                High-rated content tends to generate more reviews, particularly for well-known or widely appreciated
                films and TV shows. Niche content, although highly rated, often receives fewer reviews, indicating
                limited audience reach. Streaming platforms could capitalize on high-rated but low-review content
                through targeted marketing to increase visibility and engagement.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Trends Over Time:</strong><br>
                IMDb rating fluctuations reflect industry shifts, the growth of streaming platforms, and changing
                audience preferences. The number of releases per year correlates with the platform’s growth and
                significant entertainment trends, like the rise of streaming and global events (e.g., the pandemic).
                Platforms could analyze these trends to inform their release strategies and adjust content offerings
                accordingly.

        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="limitations">
        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>IMDb’s user base may not fully represent all audience segments, particularly for family-friendly or
                niche content.</li>
            <li>Regional differences, which could influence rating trends based on cultural preferences, are not
                accounted for in the current analysis.</li>
            <li>Correlation does not imply causation, meaning that high ratings do not necessarily lead to high
                engagement or vice versa.</li>
            <li>Additional quality metrics, such as audience retention, social media engagement, and sentiment analysis
                of reviews, are not included in this study.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="future-recommendations">
        <h3>Future Recommendations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Balance Quality and Quantity:</strong><br>
                Streaming platforms should strike a balance between quality and quantity, using data-driven insights to
                guide content acquisition and production strategies. Platforms can refine their focus to ensure content
                consistency while adapting to evolving viewer preferences.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Target Marketing for Low-Review Content:</strong><br>
                High-rated but low-review content presents an opportunity for targeted marketing campaigns. Platforms
                should increase awareness of these titles to expand their audience reach and improve engagement.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Incorporate Additional Engagement Metrics:</strong><br>
                Future analyses could benefit from incorporating alternative engagement metrics, such as watch time,
                social media mentions, and review sentiment. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of
                content success beyond ratings and votes.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Segment by Geographic Region:</strong><br>
                To better cater to diverse global audiences, segmenting data by geographic region could help platforms
                tailor content strategies, ensuring that culturally relevant content resonates well with specific viewer
                demographics.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Continuous Monitoring of Industry Trends:</strong><br>
                Regularly monitoring shifting industry trends and audience behaviors is crucial for adapting to
                technological advancements in the entertainment landscape. Platforms should remain flexible and agile,
                adjusting their strategies to ensure long-term success and audience satisfaction.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>By leveraging these insights, content creators and streaming platforms can optimize their strategies, sustain
            long-term success, and maximize audience engagement, ensuring that their content offerings continue to meet
            the ever-evolving demands of viewers.</p>
